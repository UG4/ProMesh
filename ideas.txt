Planned features:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2.0
  - Tool-Browser:
  	* Sort tools: No-groups first, Groups afterwards.
  - Layer Meshing:
ok 	* initial vertex creation ignores some vertices: separated triangles are not built.
  	  (compare boundary-from-full and boundary-only)
  - Help:
ok	* Improved grouping of script-tools
ok	* Nice parameter names
ok	* Function overloads
ok	* Descriptors for group names
ok	* Derive from base-classes in WriteClass and enable 'include base-methods'
	  in doxygen.
	* Add pages:
ok	  - ADD QT TO LIST OF USED LIBRARIES!!!
ok	  - welcome
ok	  - license
ok	  - libraries
ok	  - controls
ok	  - shortcuts
ok	  - about
ok	* Other Help menu entries simply open the help browser with the associated page:
ok	  - User Manual
	  -------------------
ok	  - Script Reference
ok	  - Shortcuts
ok	  - Controls
ok	  - License
ok	  - About

  - Log:
ok	* Read log message from resource-file "greetings-log.txt"
ok	* Simplify log-message (e.g. Promesh (c) 2006-2015 Sebastian Reiter, non commercial...)

  - File-Menu:
ok	* Add 'Quit' button

  - Script-Menu:
ok    * Perform a more sensible update of the tool-browser. Problem: Buttons
      and dialogs are currently handled in different ways and can not be
      replaced by each other!?!

  - Scripting:
ok	* Make output readable by registering print and write!

  - Delete Button:
ok	* Add question and tell: 'No undo possible'

  - Nawak-Meshing complete
ok    * create a script and all necessary tools that ease meshing for Nawak

  - Improve Homepage:
	* (Online-Help)
ok	* Screenshots
	* (Newsletter)
	* Executables
ok	* add (c) Sebastian Reiter to About Page
	* Gabriels ok

4.2.1
  - Camera:
	* Fix-View, Align-View, Ortho-View
	* Camera tools should be available in scripts
	* When zooming, move 'to' towards the projected mouse-cursor
	* Refocus does a smooth-interpolation so that the view-dir stays constant...
	  to this end calculate src and target orienation etc...

  - VecMath:
  	add, subtract, copy-construct, assign, ...
  - Save:
  	* take directory from object and not from settings
  - Delete-Object / Exit:
	* introduce 'revision' to check whether a warning has to be shown.

4.2.X
  - Compilation
  	* Compile and execute docugen from within promesh's cmake file
  - Script-Tools: Autocheck for changes in scripts and update those tools accordingly
  - Delaunay-Triangulation:
  	* After point insertion: Make Delaunay, Maximize small angles, Make Delaunay
  							   If new point is NEW_INNER and only conencted to
  							   3 triangles: remove new point.
  							   (This makes off-centers obsolete)
  		This requires 'start_new_face_recording() and stop_new_face_recording'
  		around MakeDelaunay.
  	* Allow specification of a density-function or edge-length function.
  	  This could be used in nawak to add detail to regions with high layer-curvature.

  - RemoveLowValenceVertices: Allow to remove valence 3 vertices only.
  							  When removing valence 4 vertices, check
  							  for best inner edge by resulting triangle
  							  qualities!

IDEAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ctrl-RClick always triggers special selection (even if box selection is active).
Support multiple special selections:
  - subset (including -1)
  - marked/unmarked
  - boundary/inner
  - linked flat / smooth path



QToolBrowser knows all tools and their dialogs.
On refresh-tools(ToolMgr*) it traverses the list of categories and tools from IToolMgr and inserts or removes
tools as required. For all tools that stay it calls bool ITool::widget_changed(QWidget* widget);
and if this returns true it deletes the old widget and creates a new one through ITool::create_widget();



ProMesh rework:
Buzzwords:
- C++ 11
- Multithreading
- New Qt version
- Qt Styles


Main-Editor-Area:
Tabbed View. Each Tab can represent a different Document-Set.


A Document can be a SceneView or a Text-Document etc...

"Join Meshes":	RemoveDoubles on the fly (optionally)

Scene:
- Holds several Meshes.
- Two modes: "Overview" and "Meshing", triggered by TAB.
	* "Overview":
		- Create, select, transform, join meshes.
		- All tools behave as if all elements of selected meshes were selected.
		- Tools: Camera, GridGeneration
	* "Meshing":
		- Allow selection of sub-elements
		- Elements of all selected meshes can be selected
		- Tools are applied to individual elements of all selected meshes




split-edge + swap of adjacent edges
if swap is not possible: perform bisection refinement (see below)
bisection refinement: refine connected hypotenuses until a corner is reached...

adjust edge length - higher smoothen ratio
coarsen 3-vrts
coarsen 4-vrts

swap if largest angle gets smaller and surface is kept (check distance of swapped and original line segment)

consider crease- and fixed vertices
