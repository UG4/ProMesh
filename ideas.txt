ProMesh rework:

Buzzwords:
- C++ 11
- Multithreading
- New Qt version
- Qt Styles


Main-Editor-Area:
Tabbed View. Each Tab can represent a different Document-Set.


A Document can be a SceneView or a Text-Document etc...

"Join Meshes":	RemoveDoubles on the fly (optionally)

Scene:
- Holds several Meshes.
- Two modes: "Overview" and "Meshing", triggered by TAB.
	* "Overview":
		- Create, select, transform, join meshes.
		- All tools behave as if all elements of selected meshes were selected.
		- Tools: Camera, GridGeneration
	* "Meshing":
		- Allow selection of sub-elements
		- Elements of all selected meshes can be selected
		- Tools are applied to individual elements of all selected meshes




split-edge + swap of adjacent edges
if swap is not possible: perform bisection refinement (see below)
bisection refinement: refine connected hypotenuses until a corner is reached...

adjust edge length - higher smoothen ratio
coarsen 3-vrts
coarsen 4-vrts

swap if largest angle gets smaller and surface is kept (check distance of swapped and original line segment)

consider crease- and fixed vertices




Camera:
Fix-View, Align-View, Ortho-View
