Planned features:

4.2.0
  - Compilation
  	* Compile and execute docugen from within promesh's cmake file
  	
  - Help:
	* Improved grouping of script-tools
	* Descriptors for group names
	* Derive from base-classes in WriteClass and enable 'include base-methods'
	  in doxygen.
	* Add pages:
ok	  - welcome
ok	  - license
ok	  - libraries
	  - controls
ok	  - shortcuts
	  - about
	* Other Help menu entries simply open the help browser with the associated page:
ok	  - User Manual
	  -------------------
ok	  - Script Reference
ok	  - Shortcuts
	  - Controls
ok	  - License
	  - About

  - Log:
	* Read log message from resource-file "greetings-log.txt"
	* Simplify log-message (e.g. Promesh (c) 2006-2015 Sebastian Reiter, non commercial...)

  - File-Menu:
	* Add 'Quit' button

  - Script-Menu:
	* Always refresh the whole tool-browser

  - Delete Button:
	* Add question and tell: 'No undo possible'

4.2.1
  - Camera:
	* Fix-View, Align-View, Ortho-View

4.2.X
  - Script-Menu:
    * Perform a more sensible update of the tool-browser. Problem: Buttons
      and dialogs are currently handled in different ways and can not be
      replaced by each other!?!
    * New script tools enforce a complete recreation of the tool browser.
      Idea: Store open/close states for each browser entry and the currently
      visible tool and restore those states after reload.





ProMesh rework:
Buzzwords:
- C++ 11
- Multithreading
- New Qt version
- Qt Styles


Main-Editor-Area:
Tabbed View. Each Tab can represent a different Document-Set.


A Document can be a SceneView or a Text-Document etc...

"Join Meshes":	RemoveDoubles on the fly (optionally)

Scene:
- Holds several Meshes.
- Two modes: "Overview" and "Meshing", triggered by TAB.
	* "Overview":
		- Create, select, transform, join meshes.
		- All tools behave as if all elements of selected meshes were selected.
		- Tools: Camera, GridGeneration
	* "Meshing":
		- Allow selection of sub-elements
		- Elements of all selected meshes can be selected
		- Tools are applied to individual elements of all selected meshes




split-edge + swap of adjacent edges
if swap is not possible: perform bisection refinement (see below)
bisection refinement: refine connected hypotenuses until a corner is reached...

adjust edge length - higher smoothen ratio
coarsen 3-vrts
coarsen 4-vrts

swap if largest angle gets smaller and surface is kept (check distance of swapped and original line segment)

consider crease- and fixed vertices
