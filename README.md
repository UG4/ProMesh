# ProMesh #
## Grid Generation for Scientific Computing ##

**ProMesh** is a cross-platform meshing software with support for
unstructured grids of 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. It supports different element
types like triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms and hexahedra.
ProMesh features tools to refine, remesh, partition, and transform meshes,
thus allowing users to prepare grids for many different problems arising in
scientific computations.

Thanks to its fully hardware-accelerated graphical user interface, meshes can be
visualized and edited in real-time. The effect of algorithms can be evaluated
immediately and parameters can be adjusted accordingly. The available tools can
be freely combined to construct a broad range of complex meshes.

Meshing-tools can not only be executed from ProMesh’s graphical user interface
but can also be combined in scripts. Those scripts are then visualized as
additional tools, allowing users to enhance ProMesh and streamline their workflows.

Please have a look at www.promesh3d.com. Installers for different operating systems
(Linux, Mac-OSX, Windows) are provided here together with information on recent changes.

## About ##
ProMesh has been created by Sebastian Reiter during his work at the
*Goethe-Center for Scientific Computing at the Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main*
as a stand-alone part of the UG4 simulation framework.
ProMesh continues to be under active development at the
[Goethe-Center for Scientific Computing](http://gcsc.uni-frankfurt.de/simulation-and-modelling).

ProMesh is based on UG4 (www.ug4.org/license).<br>
ProMesh is developed in tight relation with [UG4-Core](https://github.com/UG4/ugcore) and the [UG4 ProMesh Plugin](https://github.com/UG4/plugin_ProMesh).

Development of ProMesh was partially supported by the
German Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) under the contract numbers
02E10326, 02E10568, and 02E11062.
