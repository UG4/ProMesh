- Speed up when visibilities are changed in the SceneInspector
  (removed undo-points here)

Fixes:
- Face orientation during 3d extrusion is now preserved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.3.4

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.3.3
Changes and additions:

  the draw-color of faces.
- Fixed z-Buffer artifacts on Windows

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.3.2
Changes and additions:
- Internal adjustments to better support attachment serialization and
  deserialization.
- A RasterLayersProjector can now be generated along with a layered geometry and
  used during refinement. It will also be exported to .ugx files.

  smooth boundary description). Projectors can be applied to any subset and should
  behave correctly even for inner manifold subsets in volume geometries
  (e.g. inner boundaries).

  more varied refinement schemes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  display lists to the selection list only.

Fixes:



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  height at each vertex is now the deciding factor during assignment.

  * CoordinateTransform-CoordinateBuffer-RestoreVertexCoordinates
  Those tools are useful if one wants to alter subset-assignments but requires
  to transform the grid temporarily to do so.
- Added a tool
  * Subsets-AssignNewSubset
  which automatically chooses the subset index as #subsets

Fixes:
- ugx reading is now more robust regarding vertex specification.
- Fixed an issue in 'Remeshing-Polylines-SimplifyPolylines' where some vertices
  hadn't been removed even though they obviously should have been removed.

Changes and additions:
- .tex export now sorts elements before writing the output. Subset-Names are
  now used to identify styles instead of subset indices.
  An optional style-file 'custom_promesh_style.tex' is now optionally included
  by the resulting .tex file. This allows users to override the default style
  on a per-subset basis.

- *.smesh files can now be loaded through File->Open. 'smesh' is a format defined
  by 'tetgen'.

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug which sometimes occurred in ExtrudeLayers when 'allow for tets and pyras'
  was enabled.
  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.2
Changes and additions:
- CTRL+RightMouseClick now selects the whole subset independent of the current
  selection mode.

Fixes:
- Undo was broken if multiple meshes were edited simultaneously. Now fixed.
- Fixed a bug which occurred in RasterLayers::remove_small_holes (win-crash)



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v 4.2.1

- Added Scripts-Menu, which features entries to create and edit scripts.
- Removed 'Subsets-AdjustSubsetsForUG4' since it created too many subsets.
- Improved Delaunay-Refinement by adding support for circular-shells and off-centers.

Fixes:
- ToolBrowser now adapts to new/changed/erased scripts nicely.
- Zoom-in can now be performed until rounding-errors are visible.
  (distance to focus point is now considered too to compute near-clipping plane)
- Fixed special cases in delaunay-triangulation and delaunay-refinement used in
  Triangulate and Retriangulate
- Subsets-CopySubsetIndicesToSides: Subsets of lower dimension are now treated
  with a higher priority than subsets with higher dimension.
- Disabled strict subset inheritance. Edges created through splits or refinement
  will now be assigned to the subset of the orignial face.
- Fixed crash in Retretrahedralize
- CollapseEdge now also supports Pyramids and Prisms (note that new volume elements
  can only be created for some of the possible collapse-constellations)
- MergeVertices now handles quadrilaterals, prisms, and pyramids more gracefully.
  As also seen in CollapseEdge, there are collapse-constellations for which it is not
  possible to create new volume elements from affected prisms and/or pyramids.

  plane than the remeshing zone itself.
- Tetrahedralization now automatically removes vertices which are not connected
  to any edge or face. This was required since tetrahedralization may not terminate
  with such vertices present and since a user may have a hard time to find them
  (or to remember to remove them).

- Added Subsets->Separation->SeparateDegeneratedBoundaryFaceSubsets, which can be 
  applied after AdjustSubsetsToUG3 in order to separate subsets consisting of
  degnerated boundary faces.

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug in ExportToUG3 which could cause a crash.
